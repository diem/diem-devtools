# "retries" defines the number of times a test should be retried. If set to a non-zero value, tests that
# succeed on a subsequent attempt will be marked as non-flaky. Can be overridden through the `--retries`
# option.

# "failure-output" defines when test failures are output to standard output. Accepted values are
# * "immediate": output failures as soon as they happen
# * "final": output failures at the end of the test run
# * "immediate-final": output failures as soon as they happen and at the end of the test run
# * "never": don't output failures at all
#
# For large test suites and CI it may be useful to use "immediate-final".
